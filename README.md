#[The Odin Project: Messaging App](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-messaging-app)

The goal of this project was to build a messaging app.

The project requirements didn't include instant messaging, but it's something I wanted and it's something I did.

The following were requirements that I set for myself in developing this app:

- No Front-End Frameworks
- Test Driven Development
- Instant Messaging via WebSockets
